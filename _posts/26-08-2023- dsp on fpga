Title: dsp on fpga
Tags: FPGA,electronics,signals,blog,sra.
Description: 
A "Digital Signal Processing (DSP) on FPGA" project involves using a specialized computer chip 
called an FPGA to manipulate signals such as sounds, images, or data. DSP involves applying mathematical algorithms to these changing signals. In this project, programmers use languages like Verilog or VHDL to create algorithms that are then programmed onto the FPGA. This enables tasks like filtering noise from audio, compressing images, or analyzing sensor data. The project combines computer science and electrical engineering to enhance signal quality and utility across applications like audio, video, communications, and medical devices, harnessing the FPGA's efficiency and versatility.
Basically, we have to write IP( intellectual property) core for HDMI interfacing with FPGA, we will use TMDS encoding for it. Furthermore, OV7670 Camera Module will be interfaced for Video/Image processing algorithms like Contour detection will be applied to footage.

# Introduction to FPGA 

## What is FPGA?
FPGA stands for "Field-Programmable Gate Array." It's a type of computer chip that can be programmed to perform specific tasks after it's manufactured. It's like a digital Swiss army knife that can be customized to do different things, from processing signals to running complex calculations, by programming it with instructions.

## VERILOG 
Verilog is a hardware description language used for designing and modeling digital circuits and systems. It's like a coding language specifically for designing computer chips and electronic circuits. With Verilog, engineers can describe how different components in a chip should work together, allowing for the creation of complex digital systems.

## Utility of FPGA in our project
In a "DSP on FPGA" project, an FPGA is like a special computer chip that's programmed to do specific math tasks quickly. It's used to process signals like sounds or images using custom-designed algorithms. The FPGA's unique design allows it to perform these tasks super fast and efficiently, making it great for things like real-time audio processing or high-speed data analysis. It's like having a super-powered math chip that you can customize for different jobs!
